# Features
## Pattern & Crafting Tools
- [x] **Crazy Pattern Modifier** - Adjusts processing patterns, including NBT ignore settings and programmed circuit values.
- [x] **Crazy Pattern Multiplier** - Performs mathematical operations (e.g. multiplying, dividing, scaling) on processing patterns.
- [x] **Crazy Emitter Multiplier** - The same as above but for level emitters.
- [x] **Impulsed Pattern Provider** - Sends items for processing also in response to redstone pulses; ideal for probability-based recipes.
- [x] **Signalling Interface** - Emits redstone signals based on item filters, fuzzy matching, or upgrades (Redstone/Inverter cards).
- [x] **Pattern Provider GT integration** - Integrates with GregTech to set machine circuits automatically based on pattern data.
- [x] **Pattern NBT Ignore Option** - Allows processing patterns to ignore NBT data on returned/crafted items.

## Utility & Automation 
- [x] **Crafting Canceller** - Detects stalled crafts and cancels them, then automatically resubmits the tasks.
- [x] **Round Robin Item P2P Tunnel** - Evenly distributes incoming item stacks across multiple outputs.
- [x] **Chunked Fluid P2P Tunnel** - Distributes fluids in equaly sized packets, which size is configurable.
- [x] **Right Click Provider** - Continuously right-clicks in front of it. Abble of using any items in its inventory (e.g., placing blocks).
- [x] **Auto Enchanter** - Automates enchanting using XP shards and lapis, with Apotheosis integration.
- [x] **Ejector** - Export selected items from your system on a redstone pulse.
- [x] **Calculator** - Evaluates math expresions in game.

## Energy 
- [x] **Energy Exporter** - Exports FE (or EU with a GregTech battery installed) to adjacent blocks; speed up with acceleration cards.
- [x] **Ampere Meter** - Monitors FE/EU throughput between two faces, works also like a diode.

## Data & Logic System
- [x] **ME Data Controller Block** - Stores variables for the entire AE2 network, capacity depends on installed storage components. Variables cant exist without this block.
- [x] **Data Processor** - Performs instant arithmetic and logic on integer variables in the network (ADD, SUB, etc.).
- [x] **Isolated Data Processor** - Processes one logic card per tick; enables clock-like or sequential logic loops.
- [x] **Data Extractor** - Reads machine-specific data (e.g., furnace progress) and exposes it as a variable in the AE2 network.
- [x] **Data Tracker** - Outputs a redstone signal if a chosen network variableâ€™s value exceeds zero.
- [x] **Display** - Acts as a sign or screen to display desired text and/or network variable values.

## Mob Storage
- [x] **AE2 Mob Storage** - Adds advanced mob handling and integration with AE2.
- [x] **Mob Annihilation/Formation Plane, Mob Export Bus** - A way to import/export mobs from/to ME network storage.
- [x] **Mob Farm Multiblock** - A full blown mob grinder, all inside your ME system.
- [x] **Spawner Extractor Multiblock** -  A full blown spawner, all inside your ME system.
